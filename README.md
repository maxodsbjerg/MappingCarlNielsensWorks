# MappingCarlNielsensWorks
This repository hold the materials used in the workshop "Mining the works of Carl Nielsen" from AU Library at Royal Danish Library. The workshop is about analyzing the musical works of Carl Nielsen, by using digital methods. 
 
The aim of this workshop is to introduce absolute newcomers to digital methods and working with data. This is done by attendees working with the methods and material themselves. The overall area of interest is the Danish composer Carl Nielsen works. These works have been collected and organised into the platform [Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works](https://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw/about.xq) by Danish Centre for Music Editing.
The material used in this workshop is data extracted from the raw data used in the platform mentioned about. The data has then been organised in the R-data format in order to make this workshop more about the analysing the data rather than parsing it.

The data used on the platform [Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works](https://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw/about.xq) is availabe in raw xml-format here: [Download-site raw xml data for Carl Nielsen's Works](https://loar.kb.dk/items/7095cffa-6c9c-42c5-b1a7-44deae920871)

In the workshop, we will focus on three questions:
Which authors has Carl Nielsen composed to?
Where in the world the works have been performed?
Which tempos have been used most frequently used?
