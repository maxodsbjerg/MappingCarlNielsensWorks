# Mapping Carl Nielsen's Works
![](./graphics/carlnielsebanner.png)
This repository holds the materials used in the workshop "Mining the works of Carl Nielsen" from AU Library at Royal Danish Library. The workshop is about analyzing the musical works of Carl Nielsen, by using digital methods. 
 
The aim of this workshop is to introduce absolute newcomers to digital methods and working with data. This is done by attendees working with the methods and material themselves. The overall area of interest is the Danish composer Carl Nielsen's works. These works have been collected and organised into the platform [Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works](https://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw/about.xq) by the former Danish Centre for Music Editing at the Royal Danish Library.
The material used in this workshop is data extracted from the raw data used in the catalogue mentioned above. The data has then been organised in the R-data format in order to make this workshop more about analysing the data rather than parsing it.

The data used on the platform [Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works](https://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw/about.xq) is availabe in raw xml format here: [Download-site raw xml data for Carl Nielsen's Works](https://loar.kb.dk/items/7095cffa-6c9c-42c5-b1a7-44deae920871).
The catalogue uses the MEI xml format, designed to encode notated music as well as comprehensive musical metadata. The Carl Nielsen catalogue uses only the metadata part; the notated music (scores) are not included in the encoding. The MEI standard is developed and maintained by the [Music Encoding Initiative](https://music-encoding.org/).
